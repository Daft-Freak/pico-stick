# Pico C++ Boilerplate Project

This project is intended as a starting point for working with the Pico SDK and Pimoroni Libraries in C++.


You should begin by ensuring your `PICO_SDK_PATH` environment variable is set, and then (assuming pico-sdk is alongside your project):

```
ln -s ../pico-sdk/external/pico_sdk_import.cmake .
```
